        A surrogate, is sometimes needed when IVF and other procedures are not viable options for the biological 
      mother and father or other individuals that are not able to have children on there own.
      A surrogate also called the gestational carrier. This is a women that carries and gives birth to a child for another person
      or couple/inteded parent(s). The surrogate agrees to give the child to that person(s) or couple after the child is born.
      In the U.S. there is usaually a fee associated with using a surrogate. The cost can range from $110,000 to $170,000 this includes
      agency fees, surrogate compensation and expenses, legal fees, and medical costs at a fertility clinic.

    <p>
        Something to be aware about when using surrogacy is the state laws and how they handle the birth mother.
      In some states the birthing mother in this case the surrogate/gestational carrier is for all intents and purposes the legal
      mother of the child even it is not the biological mother of the child. This means you will need to adopt your own child
      from the surrogat mother. All of this should be planned out and thought through before going through surrogacy. To help you naviagte
      this confusing aspect of infertility we have placed a link above to help guide you to make the best
      decision for your family.
