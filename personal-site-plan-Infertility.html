        and humble and gentle in victory. Build me a son whose wishes will not take the place of deeds; a son who will know Thee—and  that to know himself is the foundation-stone of knowledge.
        Lead him, I pray, not in the path of ease and comfort, but under the stress and spur of difficulties and challenge. Here let him learn to stand up in the storm; here let him learn compassion for those who fail.
        Build me a son whose heart will be clean, whose goal will be high, a son who will master himself before he seeks to master other men, one who will reach into the future, yet never forget the past.
        And after all these things are his, give him, I pray, enough of a sense of humor, so that he may always be serious, yet never take himself too seriously. Give him humility, 
        so that he may always remember the simplicity of true greatness, the open mind of true wisdom, and the meekness of true strength."

      <h3>IVF</h3>
      <p>
         In Vitro Fertilization is a series of complex procedures to help with fertility and genetic
        testing to help prevent genetic problems and provide a means to concieve children.
        During IVF mature eggs are harvested from the mother's ovaries and then taken to be fertilized by sperm
        in a controled evnironment like a lab. Then the fertilized egg (embryo) or eggs are transferred to a uterus.
        One full cycle of IVF is about three weeks. These steps can be separated into different parts so the process can
        be longer or shorter.
          IVF is one of the most successful reproductive technologies. IVF can be done using a couples own
        egg and sperm. IVF can also be done by an anonymous or known donor of egg and sperm.
          The chances of having a healthy baby using IVF depend on many factors. Age and the cause of infertility.
        IVF can also be expensive, time consuming, and invasive. IVF can also yeild multiple births if multiple embbryos are 
        planted in the uterus. This can be a happy surprise for some but for others with unicornuate uterius this can be 
        catasrophic.
          Always consult a doctor on understanding the risks of IVF and the procedures before moving forward
        for your infertility needs.

      </ul>
      <h3>Surrogacy</h3>
      <p>
          A surrogate, is sometimes needed when IVF and other procedures are not viable options for the biological 
        mother and father or other individuals that are not able to have children on there own.
        A surrogate also called the gestational carrier. This is a women that carries and gives birth to a child for another person
        or couple/inteded parent(s). The surrogate agrees to give the child to that person(s) or couple after the child is born.
        In the U.S. there is usaually a fee associated with using a surrogate. The cost can range from $110,000 to $170,000 this includes
        agency fees, surrogate compensation and expenses, legal fees, and medical costs at a fertility clinic.
          Something to be aware about when using surrogacy is the state laws and how they handle the birth mother.
        In some states the birthing mother in this case the surrogate/gestational carrier is for all intents and purposes the legal
        mother of the child even it is not the biological mother of the child. This means you will need to adopt your own child
        from the surrogat mother. All of this should be planned out and thought through before going through surrogacy.
